                        If you had 15 minutes of a developer's time, and your goal was to help 
                        them become more effctive/productive at their job by teaching them 
                        something you've learned, what would you pick?
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        This blog post is my answer to that question. It's roughly a 15 minutes
                        read, and I believe it could potentially save you hundreds of hours of 
                        development effort throughout your career (among other benefits). I 
                        believe it's the highest-ROI tip I have, and I'm excited to talk about it.

                        It's not about JavaScript, though, or even about programming more
                        broadly. As a community, we've done an incredible job optimizing
                        along the engineering axis; we have brilliant frame works, tools, and 
                        services. I work for 
                        <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a>
                        , and our primary focus is on making it dramatically faster to develop
                        rich, performant, accessible web applications.

                        The problem-space we typically focus on has been well-harvested, 
                        and there's not as much low-hanging fruit left. But there are many
                        other areas we can improve our skills in!

                        A product manager once told me that he had
                        <em>three levers</em>
                        he coud pull on, in order to alleviate pressure when work is behind schedule:
                    </p>

                        <li>
                            <strong>People.</strong>
                            If a developer is overwhelmed with the amount of work they have to do, adding additional develops can help.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Time.</strong>
                            If the work is behind schedule, we can push the deadline back!

                        <li>
                            <strong>Scope.</strong>
                            If we can trim out some of the nice-to-haves, we can reduce the amount of work that needs to be done, while still
                            delivering the critical experience, and solving for the original
                            objective.

                        Let's say we're chugging along on a non-urgent feature. We push a
                        version of the change up to staging, and a day or two later we get 
                        some feedback from the designer:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                            Add 8px spacing below avatar
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Keep content center-aligned between 
                            <code>md</code> and <code>lg</code>
                            breakpoints

                        <li>
                            Title should be
                            <code>gray-900</code>, not
                            <code>gray-700</code>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Text should show an ellipsis (...) if it's too long to fit on 3 lines.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        First, we should figure out how much time we think it would take to
                        fix these issues. Remember the list above.

                        <li>
                            Researcn and brainstorm about how I might address the 
                            designer's concern without needing to invest many hours or days
                            of development time.
                        </li>
                        <li>DM the designer to get feedback.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The message I send might look something like this:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <i>
                            <p>Hi [designer friend],</p>
                            <p>Thanks for the feedback for [project name]!</p>
                            <p>
                                I've tackled most of the issues you spotted, and they should be pushed to staging in
                                <!---->
                                [reasonable timeframe]

                                , but one issue is surprisingly tricky: browsers don't provide a good built-in way to handle showing an ellipsis for
                                multi-line text. There are third-party solutions, but they tend to be finicky and unreliable.
                            </p>
                            <p>I had a couple ideas for potential alternatives:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    It's possible with CSS to do a single-line ellipsis - what if we only showed the first line?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Maybe we could limit it by # of characters instead? Say, cap it to 120 characters, with an allipsis if it's longer?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Maybe we can clamp the height of the container, and
                                    make the container scrollable? So we'd still show all the
                                    text, but ensure it doesn't take up too much space on-
                                    screen.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Let me know what you think!</p>

                        <li>
                            The developer might have missed the fact that there was an
                            on-enter animation specified, and that animation totally isn't
                            possible because of how they structured their code
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The designer might suddenly realize, seeing it populated with
                            real data, that a bunch of their original assumptions were 
                            wrong, and that this all needs to be rethought.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The developer might have misunderstood how the views 
                            should scale
                            <i>between</i>
                            the specified screen sizes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The designer might not have known that there would be a 3-
                            second loading spinner before the main view loaded. After
                            discussion, the designer learns that the slowest piece of data is
                            the least important. A new design is produced, removing the 
                            slow piece of data, and rearranging everything else to make it
                            work.
